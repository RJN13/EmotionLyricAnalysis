Emotion Analysis of "insert your lyrics " by 'insert your artist'

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the emotions conveyed in the lyrics of a song. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and quantify various emotions within the song's lyrics. The project also includes visualizations - a bar chart for emotion scores and a word cloud of the most frequent words in the lyrics, excluding common and explicit words for cleaner presentation.

Technologies Used
Python
NRCLex
Matplotlib
WordCloud
Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. The following Python libraries are also required:

NRCLex: For emotion analysis.
Matplotlib: For generating the bar chart.
WordCloud: For creating the word cloud.
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install nrclex matplotlib wordcloud
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the emotion_analysis.py file.
Ensure you have the aforementioned libraries installed.
Run the script in a Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
The script will output a bar chart and a word cloud based on the song's lyrics.
Customization
You can replace the lyrics in the lyrics variable with any other song's lyrics for a similar analysis.
Explicit words to be excluded from the word cloud can be modified in the explicit_stopwords set.
